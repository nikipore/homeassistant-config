# Node-RED-contrib-noop

A node that does nothing (passes through all messages unchanged.

The intended use of this node is to provide a clean way of handling many-to-many links (i.e., each of many outputs to each of many inputs) without having to keep track of an entire messy grid of connections.

It has no prerequisites other than Node-RED itself.
