# Installation

Install of a specific Version in Node-Red:
 - change to the installation directory of Node-Red
 - enter the command `npm install node-red-contrib-sun-position@1.2.3`

Install of a specific Version in Redmatic (on a Homematic):
- logon per ssh
- enter the commands in the order:

#### 1.2.4: maintenance + critical bugfix

- time-span
  - fixed bug that second operand displayed wrong in config!
  - fixed critical output bug #240

- blind-control + clock-time
  - added additional information in the output
    - last data which contain data from the last evaluation (when the rules was last time evaluated) - #223
      - for blind-control `msg.blindCtrl.lastEvaluated.sunLevel`, `msg.blindCtrl.lastEvaluated.ruleLevel`, `msg.blindCtrl.lastEvaluated.ruleTopic`, `msg.blindCtrl.lastEvaluated.level`, `msg.blindCtrl.lastEvaluated.ruleId`
      - for clock-time `msg.timeCtrl.lastEvaluated.payload`, `msg.timeCtrl.lastEvaluated.topic`, `msg.timeCtrl.lastEvaluated.ruleId` `msg.timeCtrl.lastEvaluated.ruleTopic`
    - `msg.blindCtrl.name` / `msg.timeCtrl.name` which is the name of the node (or the id if no name is given in the config) - #238
      - this information will be send as `msg.payload.name` to the second output if two outputs are configured
    - `msg.blindCtrl.id` / `msg.timeCtrl.id` which is the id of the node
      - this information will be send as `msg.payload.id` to the second output if two outputs are configured

- blind-control only
  - renamed `msg.resetOnSameValue` to `msg.resetOnSameAsLastValue` parameter to reset existing overwrite if `msg.payload` equals to position (`node.previousData.level`) (#223)

#### 1.2.3:  BugFix

#### 1.2.2:  BugFix

- general
  - internal object property `sunset` renamed to `sunsetEnd` and `sunrise` to `sunriseStart` (#213). This leads into problems with backward compatibilities. In any select box where `sunset` or `sunrise` is selected, it needs to reselect the right time.

- blind-control + clock-time
  - fix that note settings overwrite by message and payload does not working #233

- time inject
  - fixed bug, that interval between times does not start when load node and time in in the interval #189
  - smaller changes which leads into more options for outgoing data

- time-comp
  - redesign of the output, allows similar to the inject node set multiple properties
    - so the node becomes like a kind of a change node

- time-span
  - redesign of the output similar as time-comp

- within-time-switch
  - allows to have setup the time limitation also by msg, flow, global or env variable. #192

  - added possibility of define which time should be in payload (current or next) #163
  - now setup of payload, topic and additional payload is similar to the inject node of th newest Node-Red Version #172
  - time-inject label wrong #176

- within-time
  - fix bug not usable/visible offset for alternate times #170
  - added `withinTimeStart` and `withinTimeEnd` and `withinTime` property to message #156 + #166

  - is DST (Daylight saving)
  - week of the year
  - is week of the year even
  - day of the year

With this for example the time-inject could distinguish between using standard or alternate time if Daylight saving or the week of the year is less or below a number.

  - BugFix: random offset #90 now working as expected
  - BugFix: node error output for time input if time can not be evaluated has missing original message.
  - prepared new Node interval-inject (not finished, not available) - is the same as standard node-red inject node for intervals with start and end of interval able to use sun-times.

- clock-time
  - additional to reason or rule change, the payload will also output on these changes
    - if type of payload has changed
    - if payload is of type `string`, `number` or `boolean` and value of the payload has changed

  - The Version starting with 1... will show that this node is tested and working with Node-Red above 1...
  - After this release, no major changes are planned in the next time and the node is for the time being feature complete. This fits a version number 1.. better than 0..

#### 0.5.3 + 0.5.4: BugFix

- general
  - fix for #68

#### 0.5.2: BugFix

- general
  - fix for error on getting tooltip #69

#### 0.5.1: BugFix and Maintenance Release

    - even *boolean* is true if week is even
- blind control
  - fix for #66 if the blind not uses values between 0 and 1
  - fix for #67 mixed earliest and latest settings
  - enhanced output of the rules
  - change logic of rule execution: From rules within Until rules will now considered.
    - change should have no affect if rule setup is equal to the examples, that time restricted rules separated in first only until and afterwards only from rules

#### 0.5.0: mayor release for blind control

- configuration
  - switched latitude and longitude and added openstreetmap link/map for the position to prevent issues caused by latitude and longitude (maybe cause of #55)

- blind control
  - fixed #61 by removing misleading angle
  - fixed #62 `setMode` can now deactivate sun control
  - added `resetOverwrite` additional property #54
  - add possibility to have a exact priority comparisons (e.g. only reset a specific priority)
  - redesigned rule input by dialog
  - removed previous reset option for level operator, will now be done by new special level type
  - added new type of Level: `NotDefined`, where for absolute rules default or sunControl will be used and for min/max the rule will be reset.
    - This will allow to have only one type of time rules (until/from) which could cover whole day.
    - Hopefully this makes rules easier.
  - added per rule two different times and two different conditions
    - allows to define more scenarios
    - allows to reduce amount of needed rules.
